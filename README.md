# FraudDetection

Machine learning model and demo app for recognising fake signatures.

## Prerequisites

Tensorflow: <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>

Jupyther notebook: <https://jupyter.org/install>

Qt5 Designer: <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5Designer>

Ip Webcam: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=sr>
### Description
This project was done for Edit 2020 summer school by Comtrade. The task was to implement deep neural network which could detect fake signatures. We used transfer learning and fine tuning techniques to get the best results. Final product was build using Qt5 Designer 
and Azure as a cloud and computing service. Demo app is used to connect model with your mobile phone using Ip Webcam Android app.
